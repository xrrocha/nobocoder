# North Boynton Coders Scala Presentation #

This Scala project implements a simple spelling suggestion engine with three versions:

- A quick'n'dirty _scripting_ implementation that uses Scala as an imperative scripting language
- An _object-oriented_ implementation that exercises Scala's OO capabilities while still following
  an imperative style
- A _functional_ implementation that showcases Scala's functional capabilities while retaining OO
  features

This material has been prepared to introduce Scala to the [North Boynton Coders meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nobocoders/).
The audience is familiar with mainstream object-oriented languages and also has a basic familiarity with Haskell and
functional programming.

The presentation starts with an imperative solution that is subsequently refactored -step by step- into an equivalent
functional/oo version.
